Pipeline 2 - Java Jobs Library
-----------------

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/daisy/pipeline-jobs-java.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/daisy/pipeline-jobs-java)

This project provides a Java library for creating, storing, loading and serializing DAISY Pipeline 2 jobs for use with the DAISY Pipeline 2 Web API.
Storing and loading jobs are useful for client applications that want to either re-run a job, or store a job for use as a template for creating new jobs.
Creating and serializing jobs are useful for client applications that want to post jobs to the DAISY Pipeline 2 Web API (i.e. all Java client applications).
